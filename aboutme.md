## **About me**
  
My name is Lucy Stent, I am 29 and in my Second year of a PhD focusing on machine learning. I have just completed a MSc in AI for Games at Falmouth University.

I was awarded for academic achievement from Women in Games in 2017, and I have also recieved grants from the Girls of the Guild and Hilda Marindale to study my Masters degree in 2019. As of 2020 I was also awarded the Google Techmakers grant to continue studying to a PhD level.

The year before coming to Falmouth University I completed Cert.HE for IT including Robotics and Maths achieving a distinction grade from the Open University.

At 19 I was awarded a BTEC (at PPM grade) in Land management from Falmouth marine school and worked for some time as a zookeeper before deciding to take the leap and follow my dream to becoming a game programmer.

I left main stream school at 14 as I have dyslexia and dyspraxia and falling behind in most classes compared to my peers, I was then educated by Oxford Open Learning and received a B in double science, C in English, C in Math, B in Psychology and B in Geography.
